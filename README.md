**Fish Well-being and Feeding Conditions Dataset**

Overview:
Welcome to the Fish Well-being and Feeding Conditions dataset repository. This repository contains comprehensive data aimed at tracking the well-being and feeding conditions of fish across various ponds. The dataset includes information on feeding habits, feeding patterns, feeding times, sorting times, mortality rates, types of feed, and quantities provided to each pond.

Files:
1. Wellbeing_and_Feeding_Data.csv: This file encompasses all the data related to the well-being and feeding conditions of the fish. It includes the following parameters:

   - Feeding habits and patterns
   - Feeding times
   - Sorting times
